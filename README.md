There are many reasons why Github contents are a poor judge of character[1] but
they don't matter. What matters is that half-assed glance at a Github profile
page says a little bit too much. I'm okay with sharing things I put effort
into, but only with people that put in the basic effort to understand them. The
target audience is developers or tech-savy users, not recruiters playing keyword
bingo.

This script will make the highly visible "Your Contributions" view useless. Any
attempts to filter fake data will be met with Markov chains, fake diurnal cycle
patterns, and shotgunning fake commits into real repos. ;)

# Usage

Put git-chaff somewhere in your path, then run `git chaff` in a non-forked repo you
don't care much about.
